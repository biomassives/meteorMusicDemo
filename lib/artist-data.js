    "Esther Liana is A Kenyan By Birth A Graduate of Kenyatta University with Honors but she Uses Her Gift to Bring Glory To God For The Wonderful n Great Things He Has n is Still Doing In Her Life ..She Sings praises using the African Culture as she tells her story as a African Girl in the African way using Diverse Languages found in Africa..She Believes that God does not do what is fair but does what is best in our lives..He Removes what we want and gives us what we need..She Says That Her Greatest Blessing was Birthed from her Biggest Disappointment..She Thought That God was punishing her..She found Herself too overwhelmed and conered by Life and it looked like there were no Options and Temparary Solutions gave Her Illusions of Permanency But with time she realised that Unless God accords you the opportunity to see things From His Perspective One Might find it hard to Press on in this walk of life..She Says that God had to Remove her selfish Dream and Give her an Everlasting Purpose thus The Song IMELA Was Birthed Meaning THANK YOU in IGBO..She says In Everything you Go through in this life Give thanks n praise God n U will find your way out In Victory...Her Story is to Remind you that People are Number One Gods Investment..and Every Scar One Bears .Bears a testimony That NO! The Process Did Not Break You BUT Speak Of The Delivering Power Of God..Yes He Can change ua Mistakes to Miracles,Pain to Gain,shame to Fame..All Things work Together For Good...Says If God Raised Her From Dead,Healed Her from Paralysis and restored her health.He can Still Do The Same for you ...Her Music is a Testimony M sure it will Encourage n Bless you too",

    "SYNOPSIS DR.G.I-Born in 1990s, Nairobi KEN- worked with Hip Hop artists celebrated in Kenya before initiating a solo career with album “my praising”  EARLY LIFE DR G.I started composing rhymes at age of 12 years old being considered among today’s most talented Rappers in Kenya. Grew up in upcountry, Nyanza/western provinces, in the poorest regions in Kenya. First recording was an inspirational song, which he performed with other skilled performers/rappers in 2010. Facilitated by glass house show with ghetto radio. ASPIRING RAPPER DR. G.I I got my first taste in Gospel Rap while at high school.It was a success.And sold one thousand copies within one week in churches around Nairobi KEN. I launched my first video in January 5th 2013. The song reached the top charts of hip – hop within East Africa and international chats.And now am set for International platforms after being nominated International PRAYZE FACTOR AWARDS twice.My next song, Kitu Kimoja was celebrated by a big audience at Kenyatta International Conference Centre and later in big churches in Kenya, given its popular theme of peace and unity. The creativity of his beats and lyrics is unique and outstanding. MAJOR SUCCESS In 2013 ''DR.G.I''released a hugely popular Single promotion TITLED (HAM MBAA-meaning NO TURNING BACK)ft Chay – and Mutua; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUVuIb7LfCQ which helped to comment my reputation as one of Rap leading and performing ARTIST within East Africa,with my new Big hit DRUNK OF HOLY SPIRIT targeting MTV BASE with my next song after my video playing on Channel O; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKPtRZndk3w MAJOR COMMITMENT Known to be advocated of the word of God, who encourage and preach through music. To create awareness and encourage reformation is a controversial issue in the present contemporary society. It necessities selfless dedication, energy and intelligence and above all, THE LOVE OF GOD AND HIS CHILDREN.

    "The aclaimed Kenyan artist Makadem is a specialist in Benga music, the style that is arguably the most distinctive sound to have come out of Kenya's 70 years of creating urban music. Benga spread from the shores of Lake Victoria in the west where Makadem was born. His music is full of tradition and with a lot of story telling. Mixing African traditional instruments, like Nyatiti, Orutu, Ohangla, Kalimba with electric bass and guitar and keys, or using the Calabash and Bunde along with the modern drumset, creates surprices in the sound and show."
