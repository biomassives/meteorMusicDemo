Nothing comes easy they say and after having few trials and failures the right moment came. I have to thank my Kenyan friend and Reggae Producer Hopetone Blazze who made this network possible. I announced 2 months ago about the endorsement deal with Sizzla and his producer Caveman. On the picture you have Sizzla (Middle), Caveman (right) and Jahbar (left). Jahbar is Caveman’s son and a dancer by profession. This picture marks the introduction of Anglohili Clothing in Jamaica and am happy to work with Sizzla and Caveman in the future. More news about #AnglohiliJamaica coming soon. Jahhhhhhhhhhhh, Rastafariiiiiiiiiii!!!."

    "SYNOPSIS DR.G.I-Born in 1990s, Nairobi KEN- worked with Hip Hop artists celebrated in Kenya before initiating a solo career with album “my praising”  EARLY LIFE DR G.I started composing rhymes at age of 12 years old being considered among today’s most talented Rappers in Kenya. Grew up in upcountry, Nyanza/western provinces, in the poorest regions in Kenya. First recording was an inspirational song, which he performed with other skilled performers/rappers in 2010. Facilitated by glass house show with ghetto radio. ASPIRING RAPPER DR. G.I I got my first taste in Gospel Rap while at high school.It was a success.And sold one thousand copies within one week in churches around Nairobi KEN. I launched my first video in January 5th 2013. The song reached the top charts of hip – hop within East Africa and international chats.And now am set for International platforms after being nominated International PRAYZE FACTOR AWARDS twice.My next song, Kitu Kimoja was celebrated by a big audience at Kenyatta International Conference Centre and later in big churches in Kenya, given its popular theme of peace and unity. The creativity of his beats and lyrics is unique and outstanding. MAJOR SUCCESS In 2013 ''DR.G.I''released a hugely popular Single promotion TITLED (HAM MBAA-meaning NO TURNING BACK)ft Chay – and Mutua; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUVuIb7LfCQ which helped to comment my reputation as one of Rap leading and performing ARTIST within East Africa,with my new Big hit DRUNK OF HOLY SPIRIT targeting MTV BASE with my next song after my video playing on Channel O; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKPtRZndk3w MAJOR COMMITMENT Known to be advocated of the word of God, who encourage and preach through music. To create awareness and encourage reformation is a controversial issue in the present contemporary society. It necessities selfless dedication, energy and intelligence and above all, THE LOVE OF GOD AND HIS CHILDREN.

    "While still in Form 4, Jimwat went to Calif Records and recorded his first song, Sema Nami Sweetie (Sheng for talk with me sweetie). It was not released until he completed his O levels. On clearing high school, Jimwat released it and he was shocked to hear it on 98.4 Capital FM a few days after its release. Later, other stations followed suit. The same year, he was featured by Rhaptaz, (a group composed of Gabu of P-Unit) in Paulina which became a club hit and was used in the Close-Up Dance-o-Mania competition. He also did videos for the songs that same year. Later on, he was featured in the song Adila by Pararo and Riziki.[1] He was also featured in Jua Cali’s Kwa Album Yangu (Sheng for In My Album) and Wanakimbia (Kiswahili for They're Running), which are in Juacalisekta, a mini album by Jua Cali. He then went on to pursue a solo career. In the same year, he released his most popular single to date, Under 18, in which he featured Meg C. Other songs he has worked on are Mpaka Che with Pilipili, Tunakatika (Sheng for We're Dancing) with Wambo-E and Chakula Kinywaji (Kiswahili for Food Drink) with Jua Cali, which was featured in his album Ngeli ya Genge. Jua Cali's single, Sitoi Kitu Kidogo(Kiswahili for I am not bribing) , also featuring Jimwat, addresses the issue of corruption in Kenya[2] and was included in the National Anti-Corruption Steering Campaign in 2008. In 2009, He was involved in a UN peace campaign where he collaborated in a peace song with artists Jua Cali, Mejja, Nyota Ndogo, Mr Lenny among other top artists in Kenya. He also worked on an anti-corruption song, Simama, (Kiswahili for Stand Up) with top Kenya artists. He later released a mellow jam, Fall in Love. His latest release, entitled Fan Wangu (Sheng for My Fan), is a dedication to his loyal fans. Jimwat is set to release an album entitled Genge Nijenge! (Kiswahili for Build Me Genge!)."
